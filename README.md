# SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT USING BLOCK CHAIN TECHNOLOGY
## DESCRIPITION
supply chain management is the management of the flow of goods and services between businesses and locations. Blockchain can enable more transparent accurate end to end tracking in the supply organization can digitize physical assets and create a decentralized immutable record of all transactions, making it possible to track assets from 
production to delivery or use by end user. We mainly focus on customers and sellers where the product details will be displayed i.e. when it is manufactured. Because of the details only 
security and quality of the product will be known.

Blockchain technology can help us solve the big problem of tracking the products in a supply chain. Blockchain makes global supply chains more efficient by allowing companies to complete transactions directly and without third parties. It also ensures the increase in the 
integration of financial and logistic services, enabling greater data collaboration between stakeholders. So it helps in a very great way that we can implement or we can store the 
details of the products Using the Product ID and the details will store as blocks also those details are being hashed and digitalized so there will be more security to the product details. 
So, there could be no malware or virus attacks, in this blockchain will be helpful in our website so that the product details will not be modified as the blockchain ensures data will be immutable, decentralized, and unanimous properties.

## CONCLUSION
This project aimed to provide a systematic structure of SCM from a blockchain and smart contract perspective. Efforts to use these emerging technologies to innovate supply 
chain applications have fragmented research into focusing on various topics. Research efforts are evolving from technological studies, and prototype architecture design, to a rather diverse 
focus on industrial applications, managerial implications, and social impact. To date, we are conscious of the research motivation of not only the pursuit of specific supply chain 
objectives but also for more open collaborative networks, autonomy, and distributed governance.
